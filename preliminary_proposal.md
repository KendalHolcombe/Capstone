## Proposal 1 - Predicting heroin/fentanyl overdoses from opioid prescriber data

**1. High level description of project.** 
The opioid epidemic is a huge problem in our country. My project tries to predict heroin/fentanyl usage using overdose data combined with opioid prescription/prescriber data. My intuition is that changes in prescription number (per county) will predict heroin/fentanyl overdoses. 

**2. What question or problem are you trying to solve?**
I am trying to figure out if an increase in number of prescribed/dispensed drugs in a countty can predict the rate of addiction (as measured by the rate of overdoses). Conversely, if the number of prescribed/dispensed drugs decreases, does the rate of overdoses remain the same, while the drug overdosed on change from prescribed drugs to illicit drugs (heroin/illegal fentanyl). 

**3. How will you present your work?**
* Ideally: with a map visualization of the United States that shows changes over time of overdose deaths per county color-coded to the type of opioid that caused the overdose (prescribed or illegal). I would chart this against the change in prescribed/dispensed amounts of opioids. 
* Backup plan: Powerpoint slides. 

**4. What are your data sources?**
* Opioid Overdose Deaths from the CDC website. 
* 'Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber' dataset  from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website. 
* 'Opioid overdose deaths by type of opioid' dataset & 'Opioid EMS calls' dataset from Data.gov website. 
* Per-capita opioid prescription data by county dataset from CDC website. 


**5. What’s your next step towards making this your project.**
Currently I only have access to Medicare prescriber data. I am looking for sources/datasets to extend my scope beyond Medicare data. 


## Proposal 2 - Predicting weather from people's music choices

**1. High level description of project.**
Instead of building a music recommendation engine, I will be trying the opposite of sorts - trying to gather patterns in people's music listening habits and correlate it with weather data. If successful, I should be able to predict the weather based on meta-data from music currently being played across the United States. 

**2. What question or problem are you trying to solve?**
I am trying to study if there is a connection between the weather and the music being consumed in the United States. 

**3. How will you present your work?**
* Ideally: with a map visualization of the United States that shows changes in music choices by genre or mood overtime, and an overlay of weather patters. 
* Backup plan: Powerpoint slides. 


**4. What are your data sources?**
* MusicBrainz dataset which collects music listening histories of it's users. 
* AcousticBrainz database of the acoustic characteristics of music and includes low-level spectral information and information for genres, moods, keys, and scales.
* NOAA’s Global Historical Climatology Network database 


**5. What’s your next step towards making this your project.**
I will be checking to see if my intution that weather affects the music choise of listeners holds true, and its effect size. 

## Proposal 3 - Predciting ideal schedule for Uber/Lyft drivers 

**1. High level description of project.**
I will be using transportation datasets from Chicago to predict the ideal times of day/days of week and sections of the city a freelance Uber/Lyft driver should work to maximise his/her earnings. 

**2. What question or problem are you trying to solve?**
Freelance Uber/Lyft drivers who have the ability to pick their schedule are faced with the dilemma of when would be the most profitable time/section of the city to work. By analyzing years of taxi data, including trip length, and tip amount, I hope to seek out patterns that can be taken advantage of by an Uber/Lyft driver seeking to maximise his/her profit. 

**3. How will you present your work?**
* Ideally: A visualization in the form of a map of the city where the driver can input his/her desired shift length or the desired times of the day they would like to work. , The map will then let them know the ideal locations to work, based on the time of day or the ideal time slots to work, based on location. 
* Backup plan: Powerpoint slides. 

**4. What are your data sources?**
Transportation datasets from the City of Chicago Data Portal. 
* Datasets I will be *definitely* looking at include: Taxi Trips, Average Daily Traffic Counts and  Historical Congestion Estimates. 
* Datasets I *hope* to add in include historical weather data and historical event data to add additional predictive ability to my project. 

**5. What’s your next step towards making this your project.**
I will be looking into learning about map visualzations and GIS data wrangling packages.
