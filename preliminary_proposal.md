## Proposal 1 - 

**1. High level description of project.**


**2. What question or problem are you trying to solve?**


**3. How will you present your work?**


**4. What are your data sources?**
Opioid Overdose Deaths from the CDC website. 'Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber' dataset  from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website. 'Opioid overdose deaths by type of opioid' dataset Opioid EMS calls dataset from catalog.data.gov website. Per-capita opioid prescription data by county dataset from CDC website. 


**5. What’s your next step towards making this your project.**



## Proposal 2 - Predicting weather from people's music choices

**1. High level description of project.**
Instead of building a music recommendation engine, I will be trying the opposite of sorts - trying to gather patterns in people's music listening habits and correlate it with weather data. If successful, I should be able to predict the weather based on meta-data from

**3. How will you present your work?**


**4. What are your data sources?**
MusicBrainz dataset which collects music listening histories of it's users. AcousticBrainz databaseof the acoustic characteristics of music and includes low-level spectral information and information for genres, moods, keys, and scales
NOAA’s Global Historical Climatology Network database

## Proposal 3 - Predciting ideal schedule for Uber/Lyft drivers 

**1. High level description of project.**
I will be using transportation datasets from Chicago to predict the ideal times of day/days of week and sections of the city a freelance Uber/Lyft driver should work to maximise his/her earnings. 

**2. What question or problem are you trying to solve?**
Freelance Uber/Lyft drivers are presented with the 

**3. How will you present your work?**
Ideally: A visualization in the form of a map of the city where the driver can input his/her desired shift length or the desired times of the day they would like to work. , The map will then let them know the ideal locations to work, based on the time of day or the ideal time slots to work, based on location. 
Backup plan: Powerpoint slides. 

**4. What are your data sources?**
Transportation datasets from the City of Chicago Data Portal. Datasets I will be *definitely* looking at include: Taxi Trips, Average Daily Traffic Counts and  Historical Congestion Estimates. Datasets I *hope* to add in include historical weather data and historical event data to add additional predictive ability to my project. 

**5. What’s your next step towards making this your project.**
I will be looking into learning about map visualzations and GIS data wrangling packages.
