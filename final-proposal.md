1. What are you trying to do?  Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon (i.e. as if
you were explaining to a salesperson, executive, or recruiter).

In hospitals, the intensive care unit (ICU) admits severely ill patients in order to provide life saving treatment. One of the most important outcomes measured in ICUs are mortality rates (death rates). Doctors use scoring systems in order to predict a patient's mortality risk during their ICU stay. There have been several different scoring systems developed


2. How has this problem been solved before? If you feel like you are addressing a novel
issue, what similar problems have been solved, and how are you borrowing from those?

3. What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?

4. Who cares?  If you're successful, what will the impact be?

ICUs will be able to use it to predict mortality. 


5. How will you present your work?  
  * Web app - where will you host it, what kind of information will you present?
  * Visualization - what final visuals are you aiming to produce?
  * Presentation - slides, interpretive dance?
  
The main way I will present my work is through a Powerpoint presentation, with slides explaining my results. However, time permitting, I would like to create a visualization of 'real-time' predictions of a subsection of patients. This will be a proof-of-concept that hospitals could then scale up to include all their patients. 

6. What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?

The MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) Clinical Database. It is a large collection of de-identified 
electronic medical records for over 40,00 patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA 
between 2001 and 2012. 


7. What are potential problems with your capstone, and what have you done to mitigate these problems?


8. What is the next thing you need to work on?
  * Getting the data, not just some, likely all?
  * Understanding the data?
  * Building a minimum viable product?
  * Gauging how much signal might be in the data?
